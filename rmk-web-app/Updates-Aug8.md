**React Packages for Graphing**

ReactCharts
https://react-charts.js.org/

React-vis
https://uber.github.io/react-vis/

Nivo
https://nivo.rocks/#/


ReactCharts seems to be the most popular with good support from what I’ve read. I can play with all three to see what I find. Although it seems like React-vis and Nivo are aesthetically better, ReactCharts might have more options. It depends on what info you want to display.
